# freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Projects: Pomodoro Clock

In late-2018 / early-2019 I went through freeCodeCampâ€™s Frontend curriculum while working full-time in a non-programming job. 

This was my take on the Pomodoro Clock project: https://fm-pomodoro-clock.netlify.app

Tech used:
  - JavaScript
  - React
